# With no argument it builds the app first. Prints the image's path, and nothing else, on stdout.
#
# The contract the app holds a release to is a tag that parses as a version, an asset whose name ends in
# .dmg with ShiftPick.app at the image's root, a CFBundleShortVersionString strictly newer than the copies
# it replaces, and a signature from the same team as theirs.
#
# This script signs nothing and notarizes nothing: the app must already carry the signature the image is
# meant to ship. scripts/release.sh is what builds, signs, notarizes and staples in order.
