#   no_leftovers        delete every .app and .dmg under the repository
#   never_indexed <dir> keep Spotlight out of a directory builds write into
#
# A signed bundle in build/ is a complete, working application: Spotlight indexes it, the Finder opens it,
# and it runs beside the copy in /Applications as a second instance with the same bundle identifier, the same
# preferences and a second event tap on the same clicks. Only /Applications ever holds this app, so a build
# is a step on the way there and never a thing left lying about.
#
# Two defences, because either alone leaks. `no_leftovers` removes the bundles when the work is done or has
# failed; `never_indexed` stops Spotlight seeing them while the work is still going on.
